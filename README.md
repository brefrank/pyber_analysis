# PyBer Analysis

## Overview

The following analysis was created to review 2019 PyBer ride-share data by city type - Urban, Suburban, and Rural. To do so, our City Data and Ride Data files were merged into a single dataframe and the analysis code attached was ran from withing Jupyter Notebook. The outcome information will be used to ensure that all future business decisions are tailored towards benefiting PyBer in the best way possible. 

## Results

As you can see in the summary table, there was a clear difference in PyBer data between each city type. Although ride fare relative to urban, suburban, and rural cities averages out to a similar price, the average fare per driver is inversely proportional to the total amount of drivers in each category. The more drivers there are, the less money each driver is making per ride. That being said, the total amount of rides and fares per year are directly proportional to city type population density. We can easily conclude that PyBer is best implimented in urban areas.

From the table created below, we can also conclude that the total ride fare by city type stays reasonably consistent over the months. With this knowledge, it would be safe to say that time of the year is not a contributing factor to the ride-share data.

## Summary

Our data markedly states that PyBer does the most business in urban cities and the least amount of business in rural cities. Because of this, I would suggest focusing on customer aquisition in rural areas to minimize disparities. Potential options could be increased advertisements, ride incentives, or hosting an event to spread awareness. In the future, tracking more data, such as ride distance, would also help guide efforts to increase business.
